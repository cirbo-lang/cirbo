// TerminalRole is an enumeration describing different roles a terminal can
// play from the standpoint of logical system structure.
//
// The roles on the terminals of devices are used to imply roles of devices
// themselves in relation to one another. For example, in many systems there
// is a single microcontroller behaving as the logical "leader", directing
// the operation of one or more other devices that are "followers" in this
// sense.
//
// The relationships between devices implied by their roles are intended to
// communicate a similar idea as the horizontal axis of a good schematic
// diagram: a device that "leads" would generally be presented to the left
// of a device that "follows", so that the delegation of responsibility
// can be easily understood via visual relationships.
//
// In more complex systems, a particular device (or sub-circuit) may play
// multiple roles. For example, an SPI-driven Ethernet controller could be
// considered to be a follower on its SPI interface (where another device
// instructs it to send frames) but a leader on its Ethernet interface.
// This is why it is terminals, rather than devices themselves, that have
// roles specified.

	// Leader is a terminal role that indicates that the object to which

	//
	// For example, the MISO input on a microcontroller's SPI bus should
	// generally be an "input leader" since it is the microcontroller that
	// is in control of the conversation (via the associated SCLK signal).
	//
	// As an exception, interrupt pins (for asynchronous notification
	// "upstream" from a following device to a leading device) should
	// be "follower" on the _sending_ end, even though that device is the
	// initiator, to preserve the leader-follower relationship between
	// the devices themselves.
	Leader TerminalRole = 'L'

	// Follower is a terminal role that indicates that the object to which
	// the terminal belongs is a non-initiating participant in
	// communication.
	//
	// For example, the MISO output on a SPI "slave" device should generally
	// be an "output follower" since it only produces signals in response
	// to requests from the SPI "master" (via the associated SCLK signal).
	//
	// If a device is able to switch roles between leader and follower,
	// Leader should take precedence in deciding a role.
