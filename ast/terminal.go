	// an "bus leader", meaning that it initiates transactions.

	// For example, in a typical application with a microcontroller requesting
	// data from a peripheral using I2C, the microcontroller would be a
	// BidiLeader and the peripheral a BidiFollower, since the peripheral
	// remains inactive until the microcontroller requests data.

	// both as an input and an output but that the associated device is
	// a "bus follower", meaning that it participates in transactions
	// initiated by other devices on the bus but does not itself begin
	// transactions.

	// If a device participates both as a leader and a follower, BidiLeader
	// should be considered to take precedence.
